# **Project Proposal CS320 Spring 2025**  
**Company Name:** Ben & Wyatt UID Co  
**Application Name:** MyMeal  

## **Proposal**  

### **Application Overview**  
The project we are proposing is a web-based platform designed to create a community for food enthusiasts and home cooks. This application will help provide an interactive and friendly environment where users can share, discover, create, and organize food recipes. In addition to being a community-based recipe site, the website will include meal-planning tools that can help users create customized daily or weekly menus.  

### **Goals and Purpose**  
The primary goal of this application is to simplify the meal planning process while also creating a sense of community among food lovers and shared culinary experiences. We aim to combine recipe discovery, creative sharing, and meal organization into one seamless user experience.  

### **Challenges in this Domain**  
- **Fragmented User Experience:** Nowadays, finding the right recipe requires switching between multiple websites for new (or old) recipes and meal planning.  
- **Lack of Personalization:** Most current platforms fail to make suggestions based on users' preferences or dietary restrictions.  
- **Inefficient Meal Planning:** Many people find meal planning inconvenient and time-consuming without a helpful application or interface.  
- **Information Overload:** Finding reliable and well-reviewed recipes can be overwhelming, especially with the vast amount of unverified content.  

### **Intended Audience**  
The primary audience for this application will be people aged **18-60**. This includes individuals who are just starting to cook on their own, as well as experienced home cooks looking to share their recipes and experiences. Our target users will be those who want to save time on meal planning and discover exciting new recipes.  

### **Proposed Features**  
- A way to **favorite** recipes and create **lists/collections**  
- Ability to **post, delete, and edit** recipes  
- A **feed** that considers dietary restrictions/preferences  
- A **tagging system** to filter by ingredients, cooking time, etc.  
- **User accounts** for saving and managing recipes  
- A **meal planner** for organizing recipes for the week  
- Possible **calorie and macro tracking** feature  
- **User-generated content** with the ability to upload, rate, and comment on recipes  
- A **shopping list generator** that compiles a grocery list based on selected recipes
